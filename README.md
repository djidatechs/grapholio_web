Grapholio is a web tool designed for teaching and learning about graph theory. It's made with the goal of helping students understand graphs better. Using easy-to-follow visuals and controls, it simplifies the learning process. Plus, you can use JavaScript to apply graph theory concepts. Unlike other complicated tools, Grapholio is all about making learning easy.

That's why I developed it - to give students a solid start in understanding graph theory with simplicity and confidence.
